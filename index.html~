\begin{equation} \theta^2  \end{equation}
\[ \frac{y}{x} \]
\[ \vec{x} \]
\[ \dot{y} \]

    <p>When \(a \ne 0 \), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$</p>

<p>
(a)(iii) There are two forces acting on an object resting on the Earth's surface. They are
<ol>
<li>the force of gravity \(W\) exerted by the Earth on the object, acting inwards towards the planet centre, and </li>
<li>the normal reaction force \(N\) exerted by the planet surface on the object, acting outwards away from the planet centre. </li>
</ol>

W is larger than N, and so a resultant force F = W - N acts on the object, pointing towards the planet centre.

F is the centripetal force.

The newton-meter measures the normal contact force N, which is given by:

N = W - F

N = GMm/R^2 - mRw^2 - mRw^2
\[ N = \frac{GMm}{R^2} \]

N = (6.67 x 10^-11 x 5.98 x 10^24 x 1.00)/(6370,000)^2  - 1.00 x 6370,000 x (2pi / (24 x 3600))^2 = 9.80 N
</p>

<p>
(b)(i) Acceleration due to gravity alone = g = GMm/R^2 


= (6.67 x 10^-11 x 5.98 x 10^24)/(6370,000)^2  


= 9.83 m s^-2.
</p>

<p>
(b)(ii) Acceleration due to force measured by the meter = a = F/m = 9.80/1.00 = 9.80 m s^-2.
</p>

<p>
(c) The acceleration he measures is actually 9.80 m s^-2 and NOT 9.83 m s^-2.

This part (c) is actually not really a fair question to ask at A-level because it deals with an accelerating reference frame which is that of a person standing on a rotating Earth surface. Accelerating reference frames are not in the A-level syllabus (where did you get this question from?) Anyway, an similar situation would be that of a man in a falling lift (snapped cable). If he were to release a ball, he would observe that the ball has zero acceleration (from his point of view) instead of g because his reference frame (the lift) is accelerating. So, similarly, a ball falling near the Earth's surface would be seen to be accelerating at 9.83 from the point of view of an astronaut observing from the outside, but the ball would appear to accelerate at 9.80 from the point of view of a person standing within the accelerating reference frame (Earth's surface).
