<u><p>Question:</u><br>
I understand that gravitational potential is an attractive force but I am confused as to what the external force is and why is there an external force. Isn't the gravitational force the only force acting on the point mass?</p>

<hr>

<u>Answer:</u><br>
The definition of gravitational potential states:
<br><br>
"<i>The gravitational potential at a point is defined to be the work done by an <u>external force</u> in bringing unit mass from infinity to the point.</i>"
<br><br>

Notice that the definition stresses the <u>movement</u> of the unit mass. In other words, we are only thinking of changing the position of the unit mass <u>without changing its kinetic energy</u>.
Hence, when thinking about changing the potential or potential energy by changing the position of the mass, there is a need for an external force on the unit mass that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the gravitational force at all times, such that no net force acts on the unit mass. This will allow the position of the unit mass to be changed (thereby changing its potential energy) without changing its kinetic energy. 
<br>
If there is no external force to balance the gravitational force, the gravitational force on its own will tend to accelerate the unit mass if it moves in the direction of the gravitational field (e.g., moving towards the Earth), and it will also tend to decelerate the unit mass if it moves in the direction opposite to the gravitational field (e.g., moving away from Earth).
<br>
Note that the magnitude of the external force will need to change as the position of the mass changes, such that it is equal in magnitude to the gravitational force at all times. The external force will of course be acting in a direction opposite to the gravitational force at all times.
